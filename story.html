    <h2>My Story — Catherine Kabiru</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      My name is <strong>Catherine Kabiru</strong>. I was born and raised in one of Kenya’s oldest informal settlements — <strong>Mathare</strong>. 
      Home to more than <strong>200,000 people</strong>, Mathare is full of strength, dreams, and community spirit, but also pain and fear. 
      For years, young people here have faced constant police harassment. Many of them — my friends, my neighbors — have been taken away in the middle of the night, never to return.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statistics are heartbreaking. According to <strong>Human Rights Watch</strong> and the <strong>Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA)</strong>, 
      Kenya records hundreds of cases of police killings and disappearances every year. In Mathare alone, over <strong>100 young lives</strong> have been lost to 
      unlawful police actions between 2017 and 2024. Many victims are found in morgues, bodies lifeless and stories untold. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I created <strong>Voice for Justice</strong> to make sure these stories are not forgotten — to give people a safe way to record, speak, and be heard. 
      Every voice matters. Every recording we make is a step toward truth and justice for our communities — in <strong>Mathare, Dandora, Kayole, Kangemi, and Kawangware</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is not just about remembering those we’ve lost. It’s about hope — that one day, young people will walk freely in their neighborhoods, 
      that mothers will no longer fear for their sons, and that Kenya will finally become a nation where justice serves everyone equally.
